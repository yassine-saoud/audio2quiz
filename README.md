The project aims to develop an application using Streamlit, allowing users to record their voice and transcribe it into text. The transcribed text is then sent to the ChatGPT API to generate responses to users' questions. The application will then extract questions, options, and answers, making it easy to create a quiz. Finally, the Google Forms API is used to generate a link to the quiz form, enabling easy distribution and participation.

## Objective

The overall goal is to create a comprehensive application that seamlessly combines speech recognition, natural language processing, and API integrations to provide a versatile tool for users to effortlessly record and generate quizzes.

## Features

- Record your voice and get a text transcription.
- Generate questions from the transcription.
- Create automatic responses to questions using the ChatGPT API.
- Facilitate quiz creation by extracting questions, options, and answers.
- Use the Google Forms API to generate a link to the quiz form.
- Distribute and participate in quizzes with a single click.

## How It Works

The application uses Streamlit for the user interface. Users can record their voice via the browser, and text transcription is achieved through speech recognition. Subsequently, the ChatGPT API generates responses to users' questions, and questions are extracted from the text. Users can customize responses and options to create a unique quiz. Finally, the application generates a link to the quiz form through the Google Forms API.
